    "PROJECT BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project question:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Is there a relationship between fuel poverty (FP) and the relative Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) scores of English Local Authority Districts (LAD)  ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential ‘public good’ insight that might be obtained is that if such a relationship is established and it is believed that there is a causal relationship\n",
    "(e.g. lower average EPC LADs contribute to higher FP )  then the national Government , regional authority or LAD might target resources to improve the EPC ratings of those relatively lower EPC LADs and thereby be more efficient in reducing FP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Readership\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial hypothesis is that lower energy efficiency in a LAD is one of the contributing factors that leads to a higher level of \n",
    "fuel poverty(FP). If such a causal link is credible then policymakers at a national or local level might reduce FP by targetting \n",
    "support to improve the energy efficiency of lowly rated LADs ('the public good').\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFINITIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FUEL POVERTY (FP) \n",
    "\n",
    "The UK’s Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) determines which households are classified as \n",
    "FP by reference to the Low Income Low Energy Efficiency Rating , that is if the household has: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"a property with an energy efficiency rating of band D, E, F or G\" \n",
    "and …its disposable income (income after housing costs (AHC) and energy costs) \n",
    "would be below the poverty line\" [FN1]  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The poverty line (income poverty) is defined as an equivalised disposable income of less \n",
    "than 60% of the national median\" [FN 2]  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY DRIVERS FOR FP\n",
    "\n",
    "DESNZ[FN 3] sets out the key drivers of FP  as: \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Energy Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- Energy Prices \n",
    "\n",
    "- Incomes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project question focuses on the energy efficiency input rather than energy prices and incomes \n",
    "but recognises that whilst energy prices and incomes (via minimum wage or benefit policies) are normally \n",
    "the concern of  central rather than local government there are large regional and intra- regional LAD \n",
    "differences  in incomes so FP in LAD is a combination of factors . Separating the impact of \n",
    "uneven income distribution within that mix is beyond this paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ENERGY PERFORMANCE CERTIFICATES (EPC) AND POTENTIAL EPC (PEPC) SCORES \n",
    "\n",
    "EPCs contain scores and ratings for domestic residences in the UK ,  the Department for Communities\n",
    "and Local Government (DCLG) explains their purpose as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The EPC will provide an energy efficiency rating from A to G, where A is very efficient \n",
    "and G is the least efficient. The better the rating, the more energy efficient the building is, \n",
    "and the lower the fuel bills are likely to be….\n",
    "\n",
    "Each energy efficiency rating is based on the characteristics of the building itself \n",
    "(the fabric) and its services (such as heating, ventilation and lighting) …\n",
    "\n",
    "The EPC includes recommendations to help owners and occupiers to improve the energy efficiency of a building. ….\n",
    "The potential rating shown on the EPC is based on all cost-effective recommendations being implemented\" [FN 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the A- G ratings there is a related score out of 100 so the difference in \n",
    "scores between two residential buildings can be calculated on a very granularly \n",
    "basis i.e. : \n",
    "    \n",
    "\"Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) provides a numerical scale of the theoretical cost of energy use in a \n",
    "residential property. This energy performance rating is standardised to a scale of zero (high cost) to \n",
    "100 (minimal cost), which is frequently used as a measure of energy use of residential buildings in the UK\" [FN 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the EPC score there is a PEPC score that looks at the potential score for the residential property\n",
    "if all the ‘cost-effective’ measures were taken. It does not take into account all possible measures  since \n",
    "that might make every potential score 100 ( but at a very high cost).\n",
